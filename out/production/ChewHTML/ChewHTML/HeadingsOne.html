<!-- The easiest way to create a heading in HTML is by using the <h1></h1> tags. For example.
<h1> I am a heading </h1>


There is also a h2 tag, up to h6 (h1 will print the largest font, h6 the smallest).

Your assignment: Create a new html file. The <head> section should have a title tag with "Headings" as its content.
    Your page body should have h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6 elements with varying content in each. -->
